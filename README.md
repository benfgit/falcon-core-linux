# Falcon core

Falcon is a software for real-time processing of neural signals to enable short-latency closed-loop feedback in 
experiments that try to causally link neural activity to behavior. 
Example use cases are the detection of hippocampal ripple oscillations or online decoding and detection of hippocampal replay patterns.
