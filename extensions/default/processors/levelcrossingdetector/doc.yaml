Description: Detect a threshold crossing on any of the channels in the incoming multi-channel datastream and emits an event in response.

Input port:
  - name: data
    type: MultiChannelData <double>
    slots: 1
    description:

Output port:
  - name: events
    type: EventData
    slots: 1
    description: A stream of events.

Options:
  - &threshold
    name: threshold
    type: double
    default: 0.0
    description: Threshold (in data units) that needs to be crossed.
  - name: event
    type: string
    default: "threshold_crossing"
    description: The event to emit when the input signal crosses the threshold.
  - &postdetectblock
    name: post detect block
    type: unsigned int
