Description: Process neural data by synchronizing, filtering and combining events coming from multiple inputs in one output.

Long description: This processor derive from the EventSync processor.

Input port:
  - name: events
    type: EventData
    slots: 1-256
    description:
  - name: blocking events
    type: EventData
    slots: 1-256
    description:

Output port:
  - name: events
    type: EventData
    slots: 1
    description:

Options:
  - name: target event
    type: string
    default: none
    description: The event to synchronize on.
  - name: block duration
    type: double
    default: 10.0 ms
    description: The duration over which events will be filtered out following the arrival of a blocking event.
  - name: block wait time
    type: double
    default: 1.5 ms
    description: The waiting time after a target event has been received to check if any blocking event also occurred.
  - name: sync time
    type: double
    default: 3.5 ms
    description: Time interval over which incoming events are considered to be synchronuous.
  - name: discard warnings
    type: bool
    default: false
    description: Do not emit warnings for discarded events.
  - name: detection criterion
    type: string or unsigned int
    default: "any"
    description: The criterion for triggering a detection, which is the number of
      input slots with a target event. Acceptable values range from 1 to
      the total number of input slots. A value of 0 or 'all' is equivalent
      to the total number of input slots. A value of 'any' is equivalent to 1.
