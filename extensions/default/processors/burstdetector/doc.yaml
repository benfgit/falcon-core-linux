Description: Detect population bursts using a threshold crossing algorithm.

Input port:
  - name: mua
    type: MUAData
    slots: 1
    description: Binned multi-unit activity in Hz (e.g. from MUAEstimator).

Output port:
  - name: events
    type: EventData
    slots: 1
    description: A stream of 'burst' events.
  - name: statistics
    type: MultiChannelData <double>
    slots: 1
    description: A stream of nsamples-by-2 arrays with the signal test value (first column)
      and the threshold (second column). The number of samples in each statistics
      data packet is set by the statistics_buffer_size option.

Options:
  - &threshold
    name: threshold dev
    type: double
    default: 6.0
    description: for threshold multiplier. Same unit as signal standard deviations.
  - &smoothtime
    name: smooth time
    type: double
    default: 10.0 seconds
    description: Integration time for estimating signal statistics. Must be a positive number (sec).
  - &detectlookouttime
    name: detection lockout time
    type: double
    default: 30 ms
    description: refractory period after threshold crossing detection that is not considered for updating of statistics
      and for detecting events. Must greater than 0 ms.
  - &streamevents
    name: stream events
    type: bool
    default: True
    description: enable/disable burst event output
  - &streamstats
    name: stream statistics
    type: bool
    default: True
    description: enable/disable burst event output
  - name: statistics buffer size
    type: double
    default: 0.5 sec
    description: Buffer size (in seconds) for statistics output stream. This value determines
      the number of samples that will be collected for each data packet streamed
      out on the statistics output port. must be either equals or greater than 0.
