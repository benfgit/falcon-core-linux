Description: Read raw data from a Neuralynx Digilynx data acquisition system and turns it into multiple MultiChannelData
  output streams based on a channel mapping

Long description: The channelmap defines the output port names and for each port lists the AD channels that will be
  copied to the MultiChannelData buckets on that port.
  The channelmap option should be specified as follows

Example:
  - channelmap:
      portnameA: [0,1,2,3,4]
      portnameB: [5,6]
      portnameC: [0,5]

Output port:
  - name: channel name
    type: MultiChannelData <double>
    slots: 1
    description: configurable number - 1 by channel in channelmap

Options:
  - name: address
    type: string
    default: 127.0.0.1
    description: IP address of Digilynx acquisition system.
  - name: port
    type: unsigned int
    default: 50000

  - name: channelmap
    type: map of string - vector of unsigned int
    default: no default value - required option

  - name: update interval
    type: uint64_t
    default: 20 seconds
    description: The time interval for updates on the received data from the Digilynx acquisition system.
  - name: trigger/enable
