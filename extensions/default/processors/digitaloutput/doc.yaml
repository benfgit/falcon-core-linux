Description: Take an EventData stream and sets digital outputs according to an event-specific.

Long description: The protocols option specifies a map with  for each target event a map of actions for selected
  digital output channels. Note that each channel can only be associated with a single action (even if it is listed more than once).
  There are 4 possible actions (high, low, toggle and pulse). Events that are not in the protocols map are ignored.

Example:
  - protocols:
      event_a:
        high: [0,1]
      event_b:
        low: [0]
        toggle: [1]
      event_c:
        pulse: [2]

Input ports :
  - name: events
    type: EventData
    slots: 1
