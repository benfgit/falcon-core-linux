Neuralynx library
=================

The Neuralynx library is used to:
- handle incoming records (e.g. nlxreader)
- construct a NlxRecord object with required number of channels
- read packet into char buffer and call NlxRecord::FromNetworkBuffer

If the buffer is valid (i.e. record size is OK, first 3 fields are OK, CRC checks out), it grabs data, timestamp, parallel port
value with member methods to create new record and constructs a NlxRecord object with required number of channels (optionally
Initialize() - will be done during construction), then it sets the new record and Finalize() (will compute CRC) and finally
copy packet into external buffer to be sent over network using ToNetworkBuffer.
