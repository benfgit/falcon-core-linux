Processors
==========

Built-in processors can be found in the falcon-fklab-extensions [TODO / Link]

For each processor, a description is given of:

- what data streams it expects on the input ports
- what data streams are generated on the output ports
- the configuration options (used to initialize the processor)
- the shared states that are exposed
