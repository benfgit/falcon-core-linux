Graphs
======

At its core, Falcon is primarily concerned with the execution of a data flow
graph. The graph describes how data streams flow from one processor node to
the next, and how variables (states) are shared between processor nodes.

The data flow graph, i.e. the processor nodes and their options and the
connections between nodes, is specified in YAML format.
